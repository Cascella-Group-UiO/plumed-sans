# SANS spectra with PLUMED: implementation and application to metainference

This repository contains a version of PLUMED based on v2.9 which implements small angle neutron scattering (SANS) with a resolution function to smear the intensities. We also add scripts to help preparing inputs for these calculations in the [scripts](./scripts) folder.
