- Improved features:
  - Neighbor lists are now OpenMP and MPI parallel so improving the scalability of all actions employing them  
- GROMACS:
  - When using `-hrex` flag, the neighbor lists are update automatically at every exchange step.
    This relaxes the requirements on the choice of `-replex` stride (see \issue{579}, thanks to Chang Junhan).

For developers:
- small fix in `Plumed.h` too avoid unique global symbols (see \issue{549})
- Added `cmd("readInputLines")` to allow reading input from a buffer with comments and continuation lines (see \issue{571}).
