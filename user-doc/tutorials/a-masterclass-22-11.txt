\section masterclass-22-11-aims Aims

In this Masterclass, we will discuss how to run variationally enhanced sampling simulations with PLUMED. We will also understand how to analyze the results. 

\section masterclass-22-11-lo Objectives

Once you have completed this Masterclass you will be able to:

- Use PLUMED to run and analyze variationally enhanced sampling simulations. 
- Use PLUMED to reweight from variationally enhanced sampling simulations. 

\section masterclass-22-11-install Setting up PLUMED

For this masterclass you will need versions of PLUMED (with the VES module enabled) and GROMACS that are compiled using the MPI library.
In order to obtain the correct versions, please follow the instructions at [this link](https://github.com/plumed/masterclass-2022).

\note All the exercises were tested with PLUMED version 2.8.0 and GROMACS 2020.6
