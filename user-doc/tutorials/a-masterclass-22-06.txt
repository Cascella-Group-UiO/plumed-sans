\section masterclass-22-06-aims Aims

This Masterclass describes how to bias simulations to agree with experimental data using experiment directed simulation.

\section masterclass-22-06-obj Objectives

Once this Masterclass is completed, you will know how to:

- How to bias collective variables to agree with set values
- Develop a deeper feeling how parameters in method change learning efficiency

\section masterclass-22-06-prereq Prerequisites

We assume that you are familiar with PLUMED and enhanced sampling calculations. If you are not, the 2021 PLUMED Masterclass is a great place to start. In particular, you should be familiar with specifying collective variables.

Furthermore, some Python or other programming knowledge is required for this masterclass to generate plots and perform some analysis calculations.

\section masterclass-22-06-theory Overview

Experiment directed simulation (EDS) is a maximum entropy method for biasing specific collective variables (CVs) to agree with set values. These are typically from experimental data, like a known radius of gyration or NMR chemical shift. Biasing a CV is an under-determined problem because there are many ways to change the systems' potential energy to agree with a set point. If we further maximize ensemble entropy while matching the set point, the problem has a unique solution of

\f[
U'(x) = U(x) + \lambda f(x)
\f]

where \f$U(x)\f$ is the potential energy of the system, \f$f(x)\f$ is the CV, and \f$\lambda\f$ is a fit parameter. EDS is a time-dependent method that finds \f$\lambda\f$ while the simulation is running. It typically converges much faster than free-energy methods, but comes with the same caveats that insufficient sampling or rare events can affect the method. Another important detail is that EDS/maximum entropy biasing is for matching the set point on average (in expectation), rather than at every frame.
