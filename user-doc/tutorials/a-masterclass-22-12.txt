\section masterclass-22-12-aims Aims

This Masterclass is an introduction to the use of the environment similarity CV available in PLUMED to the calculation of liquid-solid free energy differences (chemical potentials).

\section masterclass-22-12-lo Objectives

The objectives of this Masterclass are:
- Learn to define reference environments for a crystal structure and choose appropriate parameters
- Learn how to run simulations in which the bulk liquid and the bulk solid are reversibly interconverted
- Learn how to run biased coexistence simulations (similar to interface pinning)
- Understand the importance of finite size effects in these simulations
- Understand the advantages and limitations of each method

\section masterclass-22-12-install Setting up PLUMED

We will use LAMMPS and PLUMED to perform the calculations.
Conda packages with the software required for this class have been prepared and you can install them following the instructions in [this link](https://github.com/plumed/masterclass-2022).
Make sure to install the conda package for LAMMPS.

The environment similarity CV is a part of the crystallization module and you will need to enable this module if you are compiling PLUMED on your own.
Also, LAMMPS has to be compiled with the following optional packages PLUMED, MANYBODY, EXTRA-DUMP, and EXTRA-FIX

The data needed to run the exercises of this Masterclass can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/PabloPiaggi/masterclass-22-12).
You can clone this repository locally on your machine using the following command:
