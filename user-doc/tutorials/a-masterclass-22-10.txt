\section masterclass-22-10-ex Exercises

Throughout this tutorial we will run simulations of alanine dipeptide in water using GROMACS and PLUMED.
Whereas this system is too simple to be considered a proper benchmark for enhanced sampling methods,
it is complex enough to be used in learning them.
This tutorial regards a specific implementation of Hamiltonian replica exchange that is only available
when using GROMACS and PLUMED.

\subsection masterclass-22-10-intr Introduction to Hamiltonian replica exchange

In \ref masterclass-21-5 we have learned how to run replica exchange simulations with multiple replicas,
where each replica was possibly feeling different biasing forces. A typical example are
umbrella sampling simulations with replica exchange, where each replica has a restraint
located in a different position. Another example is bias-exchange metadynamics, where
each replica is biased along a different collective variable. We have also seen parallel-tempering
metadynamics, where replicas are kept at a different temperature and, at the same time,
keep track of different history-dependent potentials.
All these examples are a form of Hamiltonian replica exchange, since different replicas
are subject to different potential energy functions, and so different Hamiltonians.

In this masterclass we will consider a conceptually similar but technically different version of
Hamiltonian replica exchange. Here, the different replicas will be simulated using
different force field parameters. For most of the exercise, we will use an empty `plumed.dat` file.
This file will just be needed to ensure we can enable PLUMED, but we will not use it to add specific 
bias potentials. Instead, we will spend some time in learning how to edit the GROMACS topologies.

In order to use multiple-replica methods, you should run your simulation using MPI. This can be done prefixing your command
with `mpiexec -np N --oversubscribe`, where `N` is the number of processes that you want to use and the `--oversubscribe`
option is an OpenMPI option that is required to use more processes than the number of available processors. This is typically suboptimal,
but we will need it in our lectures to run, e.g., simulations with 32 replicas even if we have a computer with 4 cores.

In brief, to run a GROMACS simulation where the individual replicas are in directories names `dir0`, `dir1`, etc
and the `plumed.dat` file is in the parent directory you will need a command such as
```
mpiexec -np 16 --oversubscribe gmx_mpi mdrun -multidir dir? dir?? -plumed ../plumed.dat
```

If you have random crashes on MacOS, try to set this environemnt variable:
\verbatim
export OMPI_MCA_btl="self,tcp"
\endverbatim

In the root directory of this masterclass you will find a `conf.gro` file, that can be used as a starting configuration
for your simulations, a `topol.top` file, which contains the topology information, and a `grompp.mdp` file
with reasonable simulation parameters. You have also a `conf.pdb` file, that is basically the `conf.gro` file
converted to PDB format, and can be used for the \ref MOLINFO keyword so as to facilitate atom selections in analysis.

\subsection masterclass-22-10-ex-1a Exercise 1a: Tests different temperatures

Parallel tempering simulations require the highest replica to be hot enough for important energy barriers to be crossed
in the simulation. We will first estimate how we should raise the temperature so as to see forward and backward transitions
between the two metastable states of our system.

To do so:
- Prepare an array of simulations, with temperatures equal to 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000
- Run each of them for 1 ns and check at which temperature you have at least on transition from the initial basin to the other one and a backward transition

These are serial simulations, so you can run them with this command:
```
# first edit grompp.mdp setting the temperature (both solute and solvent groups!)
gmx_mpi grompp
gmx_mpi mdrun -nsteps 500000
```

To analyze the resulting trajectories you can use PLUMED \ref driver with commands like these ones:
```
plumed driver --ixtc traj_comp.xtc --plumed plumed.dat
```
with the following `plumed.dat` file:
\plumedfile
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=conf.pdb
phi: TORSION ATOMS=@phi-2 
PRINT ARG=phi FILE=COLVAR
\endplumedfile

You can then plot the second column of the resulting `COLVAR` file and see if there is a transition from the first basin (phi in range (-3,-1))
to the second basin (phi in range (0.5,1.5)), and back. Answer the following question:
- How much should you increase the temperature to see a transition back-and-forth between the two basins?

The result depends some stochastic factor, but also on the length of the simulation.
I recommend running 1 ns simulation (500000 steps), but you can try with a longer or shorter trajectory.

\subsection masterclass-22-10-ex-1b Exercise 1b: Run a parallel tempering simulation

Once you have identified this temperature, you can run a parallel tempering simulation. You will need a number of replicas to bridge from T=300
to the temperature you have identified. As a first guess, you can place them in a geometric series (that's the allocation that leads to
uniform acceptance in a system with temperature-independent specific heat).
If, for instance, you want to try with 16 replicas, create 16 directories named `dir0`, `dir1`, ... `dir15`, place a file named `topol.tpr` in each,
where each file will be created setting a different temperature in the `grompp.mdp` file.
We will not need PLUMED for this exercise,
so the simulation can be run with a command like this one:
\verbatim
mpiexec -np 32 --oversubscribe gmx_mpi mdrun -multidir dir? dir?? -replex 200 -nsteps 500000
\endverbatim

The `-replex` option tells to GROMACS how frequently exchanges should be attempted.
The average acceptance will be reported at the end of the `md.log` file.

What you should see is that, even in the replica that is kept as T=300K, the system can explore both metastable states.

Now answer the following questions:
- How many replicas do you need to have an acceptance that is at least 30%? (the answer will depend on the maximum temperature you have chosen)
- How much is the relative population of the two metastable states at T=300? Plot this population as a function of the temperature.

\subsection masterclass-22-10-ex-2a Exercise 2a: Setting up scaled Hamiltonians

In order to run Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations with multiple topologies, we will have first to learn how to generate
the multiple topologies. Different tools could be used (including editing the `topol.top` file by hand!) but we will now learn
how to use the `plumed partial_tempering` tool.

Let's first have a look at the `topol.top` file. In this file there are a number of lines that look like `#include ...`, so that this file
is not selfcontained. The first thing that we have to do is to generate a self-contained topology file. To do so you need to
use the following command:
```
gmx_mpi grompp -p topol.top -pp processed.top
```
The `processed.top` file will have the same information as the `topol.top` file but will be self contained.
Then you should edit the `processed.top` file to indicate which atoms you want to scale. To do so you have to add an underscore (`_`)
to the atom name of the selected atoms. For instance, this line:
```
     1         HC     1    ACE   HH31      1     0.1123      1.008   ; qtot 0.1123
```
should be modified to this line:
```
     1         HC_    1    ACE   HH31      1     0.1123      1.008   ; qtot 0.1123
```
Now, find all atoms belonging to the solute (look in the `[ atoms ]` section) and add an underscore to all of them.
Once this is done you can use the following command:
```
plumed partial_tempering 1.0 < processed.top  > scaled.top
```
This will scale the Hamiltonian of the selected atoms by a factor 1.0 (which means, no change).
Have a look at the resulting `scaled.top` file and find out what has changed.
You can also try to apply two different scaling factors and check the difference:
```
plumed partial_tempering 1.0 < processed.top  > scaled0.top
plumed partial_tempering 0.5 < processed.top  > scaled1.top
diff scaled0.top scaled1.top
```
\subsection masterclass-22-10-ex-2b Exercise 2b: Sanity check on generated topologies

Notice that these scaled topologies can be used to run GROMACS simulations. We will now make some sanity check.

TODO: check that energy with 1.0 is identical to the original one

\subsection masterclass-22-10-ex-2c Exercise 2c: Sanity check on replica exchange implementation

TODO: check that acceptance between two identical topologies is 1.0

\subsection masterclass-22-10-ex-2d Exercise 2d: find minimum scaling factor
You can now experiment with
scaling factors. Try to run a set of 1 ns long simulations, with scaling factors decreasing (e.g., 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, etc).
Now answer the following question:
- How much should you decrease the scaling factor to see transitions between the two metastable states in the first nanosecond?
