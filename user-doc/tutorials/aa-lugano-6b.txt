\page lugano-6b Lugano tutorial: Computing binding free energies

\section lugano-6b-aim Aims

In this tutorial I will show you how you can use PLUMED and metadynamics to compute the affinity between two molecules.

\section lugano-6b-lo Objectives

Once this tutorial is completed students will

- Know how to enhance binding between molecules using metadynamics.
- Know how to compute standard affinities.

This tutorial has been tested on v2.5 but it should also work with other versions of PLUMED.

\section lugano-6b-intro Introduction

For this tutorial we will consider a practical application. The system is actually taken from \cite cunha2017unraveling.
It is one of the simplest systems studied in that paper, namely a guanine dinucleotide monophosphate binding a Mg ion.
This is a very simple binding event, but a very similar procedure might be used to study binding of a ligand on a protein.
The reason why this exercise is particularly simple is that instead of the ligand we have a single ion, thus with
no internal degree of freedom, and instead of a protein with a complex binding pocket we have a dinucleotide.
We are also assuming to know which is the proper binding site, since we can easily guess that the most stable binding will
happen on the phosphate.
