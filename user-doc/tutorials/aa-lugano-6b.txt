\page lugano-6b Lugano tutorial: Binding of a ion and a dinucleotide

\section lugano-6b-aim Aims

In this tutorial I will show you how you can use PLUMED and metadynamics to study the binding between a ion and a dinucleotide.

\section lugano-6b-lo Objectives

Once this tutorial is completed students will

- Know how to enhance binding between molecules using metadynamics.
- Know how to analyze metadynamics simulations.
- Know how to compute standard affinities.

This tutorial has been tested on v2.5 but it should also work with other versions of PLUMED.

\section lugano-6b-intro Introduction

For this tutorial we will consider a practical application. The system is actually taken from \cite cunha2017unraveling.
It is one of the simplest systems studied in that paper, namely a guanine dinucleotide monophosphate binding a Mg ion.
This is a very simple binding event, but a very similar procedure might be used to study binding of a ligand on a protein.
The reason why this exercise is particularly simple is that instead of the ligand we have a single ion, thus with
no internal degree of freedom, and instead of a protein with a complex binding pocket we have a dinucleotide.
We are also assuming to know which is the proper binding site, since we can easily guess that the most stable binding will
happen on the phosphate.

Since running these simulations on your laptop would take too long, you will be able to download 
all the output files for a decently long simulation at this PATH.

Before continuing, please read carefully the `plumed.dat` file since there you will find all the explanations
about which variables were biased and how.

In case you want to do analysis with python, you can use the included `plumed_pandas.py` module,
which is a preview of a feature that will be available in plumed 2.6.
It requires pandas to be installed (use `conda install pandas`) and allows to extract
colums from a COLVAR file by name.
It works in this way:
\verbatim
> import plumed_pandas
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
> df=plumed_pandas.read_as_pandas("COLVAR")
# shows the head of the file:
> df.head()
# plot distance between Mg and phosphate
> plt.plot(df["dp"][:],".")
# plot coordination number of Mg with water
> plt.plot(df["cn"][:],".")
\endverbatim

\section lugano-6b-exercises Exercises

\subsection lugano-6b-ex-1 Exercise 1: Computing the free energy as a function of the biased variables.

As the title says, just compute the free-energy landscape as a function of the biased collective variable
(namely, distance between the Mg ion and the phosphate and coordination number of the Mg ion with water oxygens).

\subsection lugano-6b-ex-2 Exercise 2: Visualizing the trajectory

This exercise is optional and is not needed to continue with the next points. However, it is 
a very good idea to do it in order to have a better understanding of what the system is doing!

Beware that the periodic boundary conditions were broken. You can adjust them using 
PLUMED with an input like this one (please fill the gaps)

\plumedfile
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=conf.pdb
WHOLEMOLECULES ENTITY0=@nucleic
c: CENTER ATOMS=@nucleic
mg:  GROUP ATOMS=__FILL__ # find the serial number of the Mg ion
WRAPAROUND AROUND=c ATOMS=mg

# check documentation of WRAPAROUND!
# you should also know how many atoms make a water molecule
WRAPAROUND AROUND=c ATOMS=@water GROUPBY=__FILL__

# dump your trajectory
DUMPATOMS ATOMS=@mdatoms FILE=whole.xtc STRIDE=10
# writing all atoms you will be able to reuse the same pdb for opening.
# e.g. vmd conf.pdb whole.xtc
\endplumedfile

\subsection lugano-6b-ex-3 Exercise 3: Reweighting your free energy

Now reweight your free energy and compute it as a function of:
- distance between Mg and phosphate
- distance between Mg and geometric center of RNA
- coordination number between Mg and water

The free energy as a function of the distance between Mg and geometric center of RNA can 
be used to identify the bulk region.
In order to do so, normalize it adding the correct entropic term \f$ k_BT \log d^2 \f$, and find
a region where the free energy is approximately constant to represent the bulk region.

- coordination number between Mg and water _assuming Mg is bound to phosphate_.
- coordination number between Mg and water _assuming Mg is in the bulk_.


\subsection lugano-6b-ex-4 Exercise 4: Standard affinity

Now use the weights that you computed in the previous exercise to
compute the standard affinity of the Mg to the phosphate. In order to do
so you should compute the relative probability of seeing the Mg bound to the phosphate
and in the bulk region.

TO COMPLETE.
