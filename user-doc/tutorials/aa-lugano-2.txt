\section lugano-2-intro Introduction

PLUMED can calculate conformational properties of a system a posteriori as well as on-the-fly. This information can be use to manipulate a simulation on-the-fly. This means adding energy terms in addition to those of the original Hamiltonian. This additional energy terms are usually referred as \ref Bias. In the following we will see how to apply a constant bias potential with PLUMED. It is preferable to run each exercise in a separate folder.

\hidden{Summary of theory}
\subsection lugano-2-theory-biased-sampling Biased sampling

A system at temperature \f$ T\f$ samples 
conformations from the canonical ensemble:
\f[
  P(q)\propto e^{-\frac{U(q)}{k_BT}}
\f].
Here \f$ q \f$ are the microscopic coordinates and \f$ k_B \f$ is the Boltzmann constant.
Since \f$ q \f$ is a highly dimensional vector, it is often convenient to analyze it
in terms of a few collective variables (see \ref trieste-1 ).
The probability distribution for a CV \f$ s\f$ is 
\f[
  P(s)\propto \int dq  e^{-\frac{U(q)}{k_BT}} \delta(s-s(q))
\f]
This probability can be expressed in energy units as a free energy landscape \f$ F(s) \f$:
\f[
  F(s)=-k_B T \log P(s)
\f].

Now we would like to modify the potential by adding a term that depends on the CV only.
That is, instead of using \f$ U(q) \f$, we use \f$ U(q)+V(s(q))\f$.
There are several reasons why one would like to introduce this potential. One is to
avoid that the system samples some un-desired portion of the conformational space.
As an example, imagine  that you want to study dissociation of a complex of two molecules.
If you perform a very long simulation you will be able to see association and dissociation.
However, the typical time required for association will depend on the size of the simulation
box. It could be thus convenient to limit the exploration to conformations where the 
distance between the two molecules is lower than a given threshold. This could be done
by adding a bias potential on the distance between the two molecules.
Another example
is the simulation of a portion of a large molecule taken out from its initial context.
The fragment alone could be unstable, and one might want to add additional
potentials to keep the fragment in place. This could be done by adding
a bias potential on some measure of the distance from the experimental structure
(e.g. on root-mean-square deviation).

Whatever CV we decide to bias, it is very important to recognize which is the
effect of this bias and, if necessary, remove it a posteriori.
The biased distribution  of the CV will be
\f[
  P'(s)\propto \int dq  e^{-\frac{U(q)+V(s(q))}{k_BT}} \delta(s-s(q))\propto e^{-\frac{V(s(q))}{k_BT}}P(s)
\f]
and the biased free energy landscape
\f[
  F'(s)=-k_B T \log P'(s)=F(s)+V(s)+C
\f]
Thus, the effect of a bias potential on the free energy is additive. Also notice the presence
of an undetermined constant \f$ C \f$. This constant is irrelevant for what concerns free-energy differences
and barriers, but will be important later when we will learn the weighted-histogram method.
Obviously the last equation can be inverted so as to obtain the original, unbiased free-energy 
landscape from the biased one just subtracting the bias potential
\f[
  F(s)=F'(s)-V(s)+C
\f]

Additionally, one might be interested in recovering the distribution of an arbitrary
observable. E.g., one could add a bias on the distance between two molecules and be willing to
compute the unbiased distribution of some torsional angle. In this case
there is no straightforward relationship that can be used, and one has to go back to
the relationship between the microscopic probabilities:
\f[
  P(q)\propto P'(q) e^{\frac{V(s(q))}{k_BT}}
\f]
The consequence of this expression is that one can obtained any kind of unbiased
information from a biased simulation just by weighting every sampled conformation
with a weight
\f[
  w\propto e^{\frac{V(s(q))}{k_BT}}
\f]
That is, frames that have been explored
in spite of a high (disfavoring) bias potential \f$ V \f$ will be counted more
than frames that has been explored with a less disfavoring bias potential.

\endhidden

We will make use as a toy-model of alanine dipeptide: we will see how we can use an iterative approach to build a constant bias to speed up the sampling.

\note Create a folder for each exercise and use sub-folders if you want to run the same simulation with multiple choices for the parameters

\section lugano-2-ex-1 Exercise 1: Preliminary run with alanine dipeptide

Alanine dipeptide is characterized by multiple minima separated by relatively high free energy barriers. Here we will explore the conformational space of
alanine dipeptide using a standard MD simulation, then instead of using the free energy as an external potential we will try to fit the potential using
gnuplot and add a bias using an analytical function of a collective variable with \ref MATHEVAL and \ref BIASVALUE .


As a first test lets run an MD and generate on-the-fly the free energy as a function of the phi and psi collective variables separately.

\plumedfile
# vim:ft=plumed
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=aladip.pdb
phi: TORSION ATOMS=@phi-2
psi: TORSION ATOMS=@psi-2
hhphi: HISTOGRAM ARG=phi STRIDE=10 GRID_MIN=-pi GRID_MAX=pi GRID_BIN=600 BANDWIDTH=0.05
hhpsi: HISTOGRAM ARG=psi STRIDE=10 GRID_MIN=-pi GRID_MAX=pi GRID_BIN=600 BANDWIDTH=0.05
ffphi: CONVERT_TO_FES GRID=hhphi TEMP=298
ffpsi: CONVERT_TO_FES GRID=hhpsi TEMP=298
DUMPGRID GRID=ffphi FILE=ffphi.dat
DUMPGRID GRID=ffpsi FILE=ffpsi.dat
PRINT ARG=phi,psi FILE=colvar.dat STRIDE=10
\endplumedfile

from the colvar file it is clear that we can quickly explore two minima but that the region for positive phi is not accessible. Instead of using the opposite
of the free energy as a table potential here we introduce the function \ref MATHEVAL that allows defining complex analytical functions of collective variables,
and the bias \ref BIASVALUE that allows using any continuous function of the positions as a bias.

So first we need to fit the opposite of the free energy as a function of phi in the region explored with a periodic function, because of the gaussian like look
of the minima we can fit it using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Mises_distribution"> the von Mises distribution</a>. In gnuplot

\verbatim
>gnuplot
gnuplot>plot 'ffphi.dat' u 1:(-$2+31) w l
gnuplot>f(x)=exp(k1*cos(x-a1))+exp(k2*cos(x-a2))
gnuplot>fit [-3.:-0.6] f(x) 'ffphi.dat' u 1:(-$2+31) via k1,a1,k2,a2
gnuplot>rep f(x)
\endverbatim

The function and the resulting parameters can be used to run a new biased simulation:

\section lugano-2-ex-7 Exercise 7: First biased run with Alanine dipeptide

\plumedfile
# vim:ft=plumed
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=aladip.pdb

phi: TORSION ATOMS=@phi-2
__FILL__

MATHEVAL ...
ARG=phi 
LABEL=doubleg
FUNC=exp(__FILL)+__FILL__
PERIODIC=NO
... MATHEVAL

b: BIASVALUE ARG=__FILL__
PRINT __FILL__ 
\endplumedfile

It is now possible to run a second simulation and observe the new behavior. The system quickly explores a new minimum. While a quantitative estimate of the free energy difference of the old and new regions
is out of the scope of the current exercise what we can do is to add a new von Mises function centered in the new minimum with a comparable height, in this way we can hope to facilitate a back and forth
transition along the phi collective variable.

\verbatim
>gnuplot
gnuplot> ...
\endverbatim

We can now run a third simulation where both regions are biased.

\section lugano-2-ex-8 Exercise 8: Second biased run with Alanine dipeptide

\plumedfile
# vim:ft=plumed
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=aladip.pdb

phi: TORSION ATOMS=@phi-2
psi: TORSION ATOMS=@psi-2


MATHEVAL ...
ARG=phi 
LABEL=tripleg
FUNC=exp(k1*cos(x-a1))+exp(k2*cos(x-a2))+exp(k3*cos(x+a3))
PERIODIC=NO
... MATHEVAL

b: BIASVALUE ARG=tripleg

__FILL__

ENDPLUMED
\endplumedfile

With this third simulation it should be possible to visit both regions as a function on the phi torsion. Now it is possible to reweight the sampling
and obtain a better free energy estimate along phi.

\plumedfile
# vim:ft=plumed
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=aladip.pdb

phi: TORSION ATOMS=@phi-2
psi: TORSION ATOMS=@psi-2

MATHEVAL ...
ARG=phi 
LABEL=tripleg
FUNC=__FILL__
PERIODIC=NO
... MATHEVAL

b: BIASVALUE ARG=tripleg
as: REWEIGHT_BIAS TEMP=298
hhphi: HISTOGRAM ARG=phi STRIDE=10 GRID_MIN=-pi GRID_MAX=pi GRID_BIN=600 BANDWIDTH=0.05 LOGWEIGHTS=as
hhpsi: HISTOGRAM ARG=psi STRIDE=10 GRID_MIN=-pi GRID_MAX=pi GRID_BIN=600 BANDWIDTH=0.05 LOGWEIGHTS=as
ffphi: CONVERT_TO_FES GRID=hhphi TEMP=298
ffpsi: CONVERT_TO_FES GRID=hhpsi TEMP=298

DUMPGRID GRID=ffphi FILE=ffphi.dat
DUMPGRID GRID=ffpsi FILE=ffpsi.dat

PRINT ARG=phi,psi FILE=colvar.dat STRIDE=10
\endplumedfile

If you have time you can extend this in two-dimensions using at the same time the phi and psi collective variables.
